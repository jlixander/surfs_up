# Surfs Up Analysis

## Project Overview
An investor is looking for information on when would it be a ideal to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. To find potential dates we will look at average temperature data ranging from 2010 to 2017 for the months of June and December.

## Resources
- Data source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.9.7

## Summary
The analysis for Surfs Up show that:
-Average temperatures are usually warmer in June. With the mean temperature being 74.95F and a standard deviation of 3.25F. December mean temperature came in at 71.05F with a slightly higher standard deviation of 3.75F.

It is also noteworthy to mention that the lowest temperature recorded for June was 64F vs 56F in December. It would be ideal for investors to intially open shop before the summer months begin.

As an analylist I recommend expanding this research to include temperatures of all 12 months to find the ideal grand opening date. Additionally, it would be helpful to look into the frequency and trends of tropical storm/hurricane that may affect tourism and beach activity.
